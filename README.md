## 🎨 Design Philosophy
The design focuses on **readability, modern aesthetics, and responsiveness**. 
* **Glassmorphism:** Utilizes semi-transparent backgrounds and blurs for a sleek, layered look.
* **Minimalism:** Clean typography (Plus Jakarta Sans) and generous whitespace.
* **Responsive:** A mobile-first approach that adapts seamlessly from desktop grids to mobile stacks.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Dynamic Grid Layout:** A sticky sidebar for bio/contacts on desktop, shifting to a stacked layout on mobile.
* **Interactive Elements:** Hover states on experience cards and skill tags.
* **Performance:** Pure HTML/CSS with zero external framework dependencies for lightning-fast load times.
* **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML structure and high-contrast text.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Grid)
* **Icons:** [RemixIcon](https://remixicon.com/)
* **Typography:** [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (Plus Jakarta Sans)
